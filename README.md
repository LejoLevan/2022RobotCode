# Robotics Code 2021-2022
This repository serves as a consolidation of my contributions made in my alternate GitHub account, @22lejo, into my main account. The majority of these contributions are related to my work in Robotics during the period of 2021-2022. The repository is organized into two main folders: "2021 Robot Code" and "2022 Robot Code."

**"2021 Robot Code"** contains the code I developed for a small robot known as the Romi. This robot was utilized in the BAE Systems Mini-bot Challenge in 2021, which took place during the pandemic. The challenge received support from Eversource Energy, Historic Map Works, TurnOne Graphics, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Leading my team through three rounds of the challenge, we achieved three consecutive awards. Notably, one of these awards was in recognition of the high-quality programming of our code. For reference, the link to the original repository can be found below:

**"2022 Robot Code"** represents the code I developed for a significantly larger robot nicknamed "Hungry Hungry Hippo." This robot was a collaborative effort with my colleagues from Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Unlike the Romi bot, which was provided for the respective event, this robot was created from scratch. The purpose of Hungry Hungry Hippo was to compete in the 2022 First Robotics Competition called "Rapid React." Coding for this robot presented numerous challenges, as the scale and complexity were considerably larger. However, I successfully accomplished the following: integration of the Limelight smart camera for autonomous movement/actions, and guidance provided to less experienced programming colleagues in developing the fundamental codebase for the robot.
